    "## Brief Overview of Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning where algorithms learn from and make predictions based on data. These algorithms are called neural networks, which are inspired by our understanding of the biology of our brains - all those interconnections between the neurons. However, while a biological brain has cells that are connected in a complex web, artificial neural networks have neurons (nodes) that are stacked in layers.\n"

When we 'train' a model, we are essentially using optimization techniques to minimize a 'loss'. This loss function is a mathematical way to measure how wrong the predictions are from the actual values. The lower the loss, the better a job the model does at making predictions.\n",
