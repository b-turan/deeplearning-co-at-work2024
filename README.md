# Hands on Optimization in Machine Learning | CO@Work 2024

## Getting Started
For the easiest and smoothest experience, **use GitHub codespaces** to start a development environment in the cloud. On the main page of the [co-at-work-2024 github repository](https://github.com/b-turan/deeplearning-co-at-work2024):
  - click on the green `code` button on the top-right
  - select the tab `codespaces` and add a new one by clicking the `+` button
  - after the codespace is created, open the notebook for the corresponding day, e.g. `Day1/TutorialMIPbasics.ipynb`
  - after the notebook is opened, on the top-right corner, click on the `Select Kernel` button and select `Install/enable suggested extensions` (Python/Jupyter)
  - after installation, select `Python Environments`, and then select the Python version installed

After that, you're ready to go and can run the first code cell!

If you have Questions, feel free to ask one of the tutors. You are encouraged to share your interim results with your neighbors.
